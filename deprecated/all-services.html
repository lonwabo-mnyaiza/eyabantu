            <h2>Project Management</h2>
            <p>Managing complex projects in the power industry is a demanding and highly specialized assignment.
A successful Project Manager must simultaneously manage the four basic elements of a project: resources, time, money and scope. All must be managed effectively together within a highly constraint environment if the project is to be a success.

Eya Bantu provides project management services for medium and large projects in the power sector and industrial sector. We provide project management services for new build substation, extensions, bulk supplies, reticulation, electrification, renewable energy projects, high mast lighting and energy management. We have a team of highly experienced professional project managers capable of managing your project from inception to close out. Our clients include government organizations, utility companies, municipalities, property owners and independent power producers.</p>

        <div class="span4">
          <h2>Renewable Power Project</h2>
            <p>Renewable power is the future source of energy globally and in South Africa.
The South African Renewable Energy Plan aims to generate 3725 MW of renewable energy by 2016 and 17,800 MW by 2030.
We at Eya Bantu recognize this trend and are fully committed to supporting this initiative through our consulting services as projects managers, energy advisors and with innovative designs and engineering. We have recently commissioned the first IPP grid connected wind turbine in the East London area and we anticipate many more large scale projects in an era of solar-based energies such as photovoltaics, thermal heating and cooling, wind, biomass and hydro power to propel our country and our community into the future</p>

        <div class="span4">
         <h2>Power System Studies</h2>
            <p>Power system studies are required in project development as well as field services.
In project development it is used from pre-feasibility, feasibility, design and engineering stages to accurately model the power system to determine equipment sizing, configuration and to predict performance of the power system components under different operating conditions. Typical studies include master plans, load forecast, feasibility studies, techo-financial analysis, network modeling, equipment sizing, loadflow, short circuit, stability, motor starting, harmonic analysis and filter sizing, reactive power control and earthing. Power system simulation software is also used to perform protection relays settings and coordination. Using the software improved accuracy and saved time in performing coordination and store settings in a database. Eya Bantu supports all industry standard simulation software packages like DIgSILENT, ETAP and ReticMaster.</p>

        <div class="span4">
            <h2>Thermography</h2>
            <p>Infrared thermography reveals what is not visible to the eye.
It is used for early detection of hot spots due to faulty equipment, incorrect installation or non standard electrical conditions such as loose connections, overloaded or imbalanced circuits, faulty breakers, damaged switches and faulty fuses. By early detection possible catastrophe can be prevented, potentially saving lives and damage to equipment and production downtime. Typical inspections include substations, transformers, feed poles, Main incoming services, plant switchgear, capacitor banks, Main switchboards and disconnects, Main distribution panels, UPS systems, Generator controls and transfer switches, starters and Service disconnects for motors and machine control panels. Eya Bantu has state of the art infra red cameras and an experienced team that are available 24/7.</p>

            <h2>Cable Fault Finding & Location</h2>
            <p>Finding the location of an underground cable fault can be like finding a needle in a haystack.
Using the best locating methods, coupled with new detection technologies can make this task much easier and less time consuming. There are two basic methods of locating an underground cable fault, sectionalizing and thumping. Sectionalizing could mean physically cutting the cable to divide it into successively smaller sections to narrow down the search for a fault. Thumping requires a high current at voltages as high as 25kV to make detection possible and is therefore a very specialized task. Our experienced technicians are proficient with these methods and with their skill, experience and using our state of the art detection equipment are able to locate cable faults safely and efficiently without damaging the cable. We have a 24/7 standby team ready to assist you with all your cable fault finding requirements. We also provide cable locating service using latest technology and cable locator instruments.</p>

        <div class="span4">
            <h2>Transformer Oil Testing</h2>
            <p>The insulation of transformer oil fulfils the purpose of insulating as well as cooling.
Thus, the dielectric quality of transformer oil is a matter of secure operation of a transformer. Since transformer oil deteriorates in its insulation and cooling behaviour due to ageing and pollution by dust particles or humidity, and due to its vital role, transformer oil must be subject to oil tests on a regular basis. Periodic execution of transformer oil testing is in the interest of energy supplying companies, as potential damage to the transformer insulation can be avoided by well timed substitution of the transformer oil. Lifetime of plant can be substantially increased and the requirement for new investment may be delayed. To assess the insulating property of dielectric transformer oil, a sample of the transformer oil is taken and its breakdown voltage is measured. The lower the resulting breakdown voltage, the poorer the quality of the transformer oil. Our technicians are equipped and trained with state of the art portable oil testers making fast on-site oil testing possible. Please contact us for further information or to discuss your transformer oil testing requirements.</p>
